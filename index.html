<p> Make an object of type "task" that should be added to a queue, and every 16ms only do what's in the queue </p>
<p> Better to store the bricks in a list (with coordinates) and only check the bricks that exist</p>
<p> Make the collision all edges, and on bricks - make it hard</p>
<p> Bonus's dropping from bricks </p>
<p> Depending on where you hit the ball on the paddle, the ball should move more. Farther out should speed it up,
while closer to center is better. Make a color gradient of sorts to explain this.</p>
<p> A time variable, which modifies the ball's speed over time. Perhaps it's a function of how many bricks are left</p>
<p> collision detection for corners, by checking outline of the cirle - then flipping ball direction</p>
<p> Use a rombus for the angle shots </p>
